# Privacy Policy for TidyLi

**Effective Date:** February 24, 2025

## 1. Introduction

TidyLi ("we," "our," "us") provides users with a streamlined way to manage their LinkedIn connections by allowing them to view their own connection list and delete unnecessary connections. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when using our service.

## 2. Data Collection

TidyLi collects and processes the following types of data from LinkedIn (with user consent):

- **Connection List:** To allow users to review and manage their LinkedIn connections.
- **Messages (Optional):** To provide insights into past interactions before deciding to remove a connection.

We do not collect or store passwords. All authentication is handled via LinkedIn’s official OAuth system.

## 3. Data Usage

The collected data is used solely to:

- Display a user's LinkedIn connections within the TidyLi interface.
- Allow users to remove unwanted connections directly from the app.
- Provide a better user experience by identifying inactive or low-value connections.

We do not sell, share, or distribute your LinkedIn data to third parties.

## 4. Data Storage & Security

TidyLi does not permanently store user data. We access the connection list in real-time and process deletions without saving or caching your LinkedIn data. Any temporary session data is automatically deleted once the session ends.

## 5. Data Deletion

Since TidyLi does not store user data, no separate deletion request is required. However, users can revoke LinkedIn API permissions at any time via their LinkedIn account settings.

## 6. Compliance & User Rights

TidyLi complies with LinkedIn’s API policies and relevant data protection laws (such as GDPR). Users can request additional details about data usage by contacting [tidyli@lab4.berlin](mailto:tidyli@lab4.berlin).
